    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>&lt;strong&gt;For Birth Registration and Certificates:&lt;/strong&gt; To apply for a Birth Certificate, you must first register the birth.
The birth must be registered with the concerned local authorities within 21 days of its occurrence, by
filling up the form prescribed by the Registrar. Birth Certificate is then issued after verification with the
actual records of the concerned hospital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

generally available with the area’s local body authorities, or with the Registrar who maintains the

    <value>&lt;p class="card-text text-muted"&gt;
      Post-independence, the Registration of Births and Death Act (RBD Act) was
      enacted in 1969 to promote uniformity and comparability in the
      registration of Births and Deaths across the country and compilation of
      vital statistics based thereon. With the enactment of the Act,
      registration of births, deaths and still births has become mandatory in
      India. The Registrar General, India (RGI) at the Central Government level
      coordinates and unifies the activities of registration throughout the
      country. However, implementation of the statute is vested with the State
      Governments. The registration of births and deaths in the country is done
      by the functionaries appointed by the State Governments.
    
    &lt;br /&gt;
    
      In India, it is mandatory under the law (as per the Registration of Births
      &amp;amp; Deaths Act, 1969) to register every birth/death with the concerned
      State/UT Government within 21 days of its occurrence. The
      Government accordingly has provided for a well-defined system for
      registration of birth/death, with the Registrar General, India, at the
      center and the Chief Registrars in States, running through district
      registrars to the village and town registrars at the periphery. 
   
    &lt;br /&gt;

    
      The responsibilities for reporting the events have been prescribed
      separately for domiciliary events as well as Institutional events, the
      details of which are given below:
      &lt;ul&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;li class="card-text text-muted"&gt;(I) In respect of birth or death
      occurred in a house, it is the duty of the Head of the house/household or
      nearest relative of the head present in the house or in the absence of any
      such person, the oldest male person present therin during the said period
      is responsible to report the event to the concerned Registrar/ sub
      Registrar. These events can also be reported through the prescribed
      Notifiers such as Anaganwadi Workers, ANM’s, ASHA’s and others. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
      &lt;li class="card-text text-muted"&gt;(II)
      In respect of birth or death occurred in a hospital, health center,
      Maternity or nursing home or other such institutions, the medical officer
      In-charge or any person authorized by him in this behalf is responsible
      for reporting
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;p class="card-text text-muted"&gt;
    A Birth Certificate is the most important identity document that makes it
    possible for anyone in possession of it to benefit from a gamut of services
    offered by the Indian Government to its citizens. It becomes necessary to
    obtain a Birth Certificate because it serves to establish the date and fact
    of one’s birth for a whole range of purposes, like acquiring the right to
    vote, admission to schools and to the Government Service, claiming the right
    to marry at the legally permissible age, settlement of inheritance and
    property rights, and obtaining Government-issued identity documents like a
    driving license or passport. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
    Similarly, A Death Certificate is a document
    issued by the Government to the nearest relatives of the deceased, stating
    the date, fact, and cause of death. It is essential to register death to
    prove the time and date of death, to establish the fact of death for
    relieving the individual from social, legal and official obligations, to
    enable settlement of property inheritance, and to authorize the family to
    collect insurance and other benefits.

    <value>A driving license is basically an official document issued by the Government of India, permitting
individuals to operate or drive a motorized vehicle such as a car, motorbike, truck, bus, etc., on a
public road, without any supervision. In India, a driving license is issued by the Regional Transport
Authority (RTA) or Regional Transport Office (RTO) of that state. The Motor Vehicles Act of 1988
states that no individual without the Driving license is authorized to drive a motor vehicle in a public
place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An individual who wants to drive any type of motor vehicle in India must get his/her learner&amp;#39;s license
first. A learner’s license is issued for learning. After a month of the issued learner’s license, the
person must appear for the test in front of an RTO authority, who upon proper examination, will
declare if he/she has passed the exam or not.</value>

    <value>Documentation Required for  Pan Card</value>
  </data>
  <data name="panoverviewText" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>PAN, or permanent account number, is a unique 10-digit alphanumeric identity allotted to each taxpayer
by the Income Tax Department under the supervision of the Central Board of Direct Taxes. It also serves
as an identity proof. PAN is mandatory for financial transactions such as receiving taxable salary or
professional fees, sale or purchase of assets above specified limits, buy mutual funds and more.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The primary objective of PAN is to use a universal identification key to track financial transactions that
might have a taxable component to prevent tax evasion. The PAN number remains unaffected by
change of address throughout India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Who requires a PAN?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; Anybody who earns a taxable income in India, including foreign nationals who pay taxes here&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt; Anybody who runs a business (be it retail, services or consultancy) that had total sales, turnover or
gross receipt exceeding Rs 5 lakh in the previous financial year&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The PAN is broadly issued under the categories:&lt;br&gt;
a. Individual &amp;amp; HUF
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;- Indian Taxpaying Nationals&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;- Foreign Nationals Paying taxes in India&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;- Hindu Undivided Family (HUF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
b. Company.
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt; association of persons, body of individuals, company, trust, limited liability partnership, firm.&lt;/li&gt;

    <value>Pan Card Overview</value>
  </data>
  <data name="panprocessText" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The process to apply for a PAN differs for individuals and Companies:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;. PAN Application Process for Individuals:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
a. You can apply for a PAN card online either via NSDL or UTITSL websites. Both have been
authorised to issue PAN cards in India. To apply a PAN on NSDL website, follow the steps below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
b. On the page linked in the previous step, you will see a form titled &lt;strong&gt;.Online PAN application.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Under &lt;strong&gt;Application Type&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;select New PAN - Indian Citizen (Form 49A). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you’re a foreign national, select &lt;strong&gt;New PAN - Foreign Citizen (Form 49AA).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
c. Select the category of PAN card you need. For most people, this will be &lt;strong&gt;Individual&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

d. Now fill in your personal details such as name, date of birth, mobile number, etc., enter the
captcha code and &lt;strong&gt;Submit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
e. Now you have three choices — authenticate via Aadhaar to avoid sending any documents, scan
documents and upload them via e-sign, or to physically submit documents&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you chose to authenticate via Aadhaar, it needs an OTP and payment. If you don’t want that
option, the steps for the other two are similar except the part where you have to send
documents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2. PAN Application Process for a Company:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
a. Visit the Paperless PAN Application Section on the NSDL website. Select Form 49A or 49AA from
the ‘Application Type’ dropdown menu and select ‘category’ as ‘Company’ from the next
dropdown menu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
b. Fill out the Title (M/s), Name of the Company (in the ‘Last Name’ Box), Date of Incorporation of
the Company, email ID and Contact Number. Fill the Captcha Code and proceed. A token
number will be generated and sent to the email address provided by you. You can now continue
the PAN Application.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
c. In case of Company PAN Application, e-KYC and e-sign facility is not available and the application
documents can be only forwarded physically. The company’s name, email ID and contact
number will be prefilled. You only have to fill the Registration Number of your company. Submit
and proceed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
d. In this part, you have to mention the source of income of the company. Select ‘Income from
Business / Profession’ and from the menu provided, select the type of business. If you are also
earning other income from house property, capital gains or other sources, mention the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
e. Next you have to fill out the office address which will also be your communication address in the
PAN database. Other contact details will be prefilled. Proceed to the next step.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
f. Now you have to provide the Assessing Officer (AO) Code which is designated according to area
jurisdiction of your location. You can click on the ‘Indian Citizen’ option and then select ‘State’
and ‘City’. You can also go to the ‘AO Code search for PAN’ Page on NSDL Website.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
g. You can now proceed to the documentation page. Sign the declaration. Here you will be asked
about your relationship with the company. Either the Director or an Authorised Signatory can
apply for a company’s PAN. Submit the form. Now you have to upload scanned copies of the
required documents. Your complete filled form will be available for review. If all the information
provided by you is correct, submit the form.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
h. You are now required to pay the fee. The payment can be made by way of demand draft, credit
card/debit card or net banking. In case of company, only a director can make the credit/debit
card or net banking payment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
i. On successful payment of the fee, an acknowledgement receipt will be generated. The
acknowledgement number mentioned on the receipt can be used by the applicant to check the

PAN application status of the company’s PAN. The duly signed acknowledgement has to be sent
to the NSDL office with the copy of registration certificate and demand draft (if any).</value>

  <data name="rationcardoverviewText" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ration card, a document issued by the state government, serves as a proof of identity for Indian
citizens. As per the Public Distribution System (PDS), it can be used for the purchase of essential
commodities from &amp;#39;fair price&amp;#39; or ration shops. Ration cards come in multiple categories, which are
issued as per the earning capacity of an individual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Any person who is a legal citizen of India can only apply for a ration card. The applicant should not hold
ration card in other states and not possess any other family card in the same state. These are issued based
upon the total members in a family, and each category of the ration card determines an individual’s
entitlement to certain rationed goods. Individuals with higher earning capacity (as fixed by the respective
state government) cannot obtain rations at a subsidized cost.</value>

  <data name="rationcardprocessText" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Each state Government has prescribed separate application forms which can be submitted manually, or,
online for obtaining a ration card. Common procedures that are generally followed in most of the states
are given below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The applicant is required to pay a basic minimum fee along with the application form. Once the
application is submitted, the file is sent for field verification. The officer in charge of verification must
inspect and certify the details submitted by the applicant for further processing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This inspection must be carried out generally within 30 days from the date of submission of the
application. Once all the details are verified and confirmed by the officer, ration card is created and issued
to the applicant based on their annual income. If the application is rejected, a rejection letter is issued with
reasons for the same to the applicant.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Identification of beneficiaries/households under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA) and
issuance of Antodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Household (PHH) ration cards is dealt by the
respective State Government / UT Administration.</value>
